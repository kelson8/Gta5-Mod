# Gta5-TestMod
This is a basic mod that I am creating with ScriptHookVDotNet and LemonUI to learn C# coding.

The current keybind to open the menu is Control + F, I'll eventually make a config option for it. 

I plan on adding more features as I learn C#.

# Functions currently in this mod:
## Player menu
Fix player (heal player health and armor)

Invincible (Gives you god mode)

Wanted level (Change wanted level from 0-5)

Never wanted

Spawn into vehicle (Puts you in the driver seat of a car spawned with this menu)

Super jump

## Vehicle menu
Vehicle spawner (only thing in here so far)

## Weapon menu
Give all weapons (only thing in here so far)

## Cheat menu
This is currently a placeholder for future use.

## Teleport menu
Teleport to marker (only thing in here so far)

## Ped Changer menu
Change ped to one in the list.
